This assignment involves creating a secure system that uses Authentication, Authorization, and Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) to manage user access to resources based on their roles. Here’s how you can approach building such a system step-by-step:

1. Authentication System
Objective: Implement a secure system for users to register, log in, and log out.

Registration:
Users should be able to create accounts by providing unique information like username, email, and password.
Passwords should be securely stored using hashing algorithms (e.g., bcrypt or Argon2).
Login:
Users log in by providing their credentials (username and password).
Once authenticated, the system generates a token (JWT or OAuth token) for session management.
Logout:
A secure mechanism for invalidating or revoking the token should be in place, ensuring a clean logout process.
Implementation Tips:

JWT (JSON Web Token) can be used for managing user sessions. After a user logs in, a JWT is created and stored either in local storage or as a secure HTTP-only cookie.
Password Hashing: Use libraries like bcrypt to hash passwords before storing them in the database.
2. Role-Based Authorization
Objective: Assign roles to users and authorize their access to specific resources based on their role.

Roles: Create different roles such as Admin, User, Moderator, etc.
Permissions: Define what each role can do. For example:
Admin: Access to all resources, including user management.
Moderator: Access to moderate content (edit or delete user posts).
User: Access to view and interact with content.
Implementation Tips:

Store user roles in the database, associating them with each user.
When users make requests to access certain resources, the system checks their role and allows access based on predefined permissions.
3. Implement RBAC (Role-Based Access Control)
Objective: Ensure that resources can only be accessed by users with the correct role and permissions.

Access Control Logic: Based on the user’s role, you’ll need middleware that checks if they have permission to access certain routes or perform certain actions.
Example: A route /admin/dashboard should only be accessible to users with the Admin role.
Implementation Tips:

Middleware can intercept requests and verify user roles before granting access.
You can use libraries like Casbin (for Node.js), django-guardian (for Django), or Pundit (for Ruby on Rails) for role-based permission handling.
4. Security Best Practices
Password Security: Ensure you’re salting and hashing passwords. Never store plain text passwords.
JWT Security: Use secure tokens with appropriate expiration times and handle token invalidation during logout.
CSRF Protection: Protect against Cross-Site Request Forgery by using anti-CSRF tokens in forms.
Rate Limiting: Prevent brute-force attacks on login endpoints by limiting the number of login attempts.
5. Code Structure
Ensure your code is well-organized, with clear separation of concerns:

Models: For User, Role, and Permission entities.
Routes: API endpoints for authentication, authorization, and role-based access control.
Middleware: For validating JWTs and checking user roles.
6. Creative Enhancements
To stand out, you could include:

User Role Management UI: A user-friendly dashboard where admins can assign and manage user roles.
Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA): Add an extra layer of security during login.
Audit Logging: Track and log actions based on user roles for accountability.
Example Stack
Backend: Node.js with Express (or Flask/Django)
Authentication: JWT or OAuth (with libraries like jsonwebtoken in Node.js)
Database: MongoDB or PostgreSQL for storing user information and roles
Security Libraries: bcrypt for password hashing, helmet for HTTP security headers.
